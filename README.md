An ultimate tool For Them Who See. Or just some geodesic calc.

I worked some time as a land surveyor and it shows me some troubles on this. There was a need to use a calculator a lot, but with notes on some numbers and some numbers in memory. 
E.g. to calculate depth of the trench you need a builder's level, graduated staff and a survey benchmark. Also some another man to hold the staff, but it doesn't matter.
When you calibrate your level, you know the horizon of your device - and for some time you need to remember this height. Then, when you will "shoot" to trench, you will compute difference between your known horizon, got height of trench/ground and project height. During this work you'll have to use 2-3 numbers, usally much more. For more safety, this numbers should be noted. And horizon height would be counted times and times.
